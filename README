This is a repository of my accepted leetcode submissions.
My leetcode profile is: https://leetcode.com/u/whenthesunfalls/

Included in this repository is a python script to export accepted submission code from leetcode's website.
The submission only works for the export of your own submissions, since leetcode doesn't allow viewing of code
beyond the last 20 submissions for anyone but yourself. In order to export your own submissions, you must log in to 
leetcode on a web browser. From there you need to access your browser's network information (on Chrome this is Ctrl + Shift + i)
and find any network packet from leetcode and fill in the header dictionary listed in the script. Additionally, you must copy
the cookies found in the request header into the cookies string in the script. The most important of these are the
csrf token and LEETCODE_SESSION cookie. The script should run properly if this is done correctly on Firefox or Chrome.
I am unsure about other browsers. NOTE: only c++, python, and java submissions supported at the moment. This can be changed
through editing of the file extension dictionary in the script.

I'd like to add functionality to split problems based on difficulty, but in order to do so I need a way of resolving
question difficulty labels. I couldn't find a repository for difficulty labels other than leetcode itself and I couldn't
get the difficulty label html elements to load with requests or BeautifulSoup, likely a result of anti-scraping measures
or incompatibility between scraping tools and the way the leetcode DOM loads.
